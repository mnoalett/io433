A protocol is defined by a few parameters passed to the constructor in the following order:
name: the name of the protocol
n_bits: the number of bits for a single key
timings_table: the timings for encoding the zero and the one
preamble, a recurring pattern at the beginning of each key
repetition: number of transmissions per key in the bruteforce
